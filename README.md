The project aims at implementing recommendation systems using two different approaches, machine learning and cloud-based Amazon personalize service. 
Movie lens data set is used for both the approaches. Using AWS personalise, various campaigns with different solutions are built and based on the pre-defined solution algorithms, movie recommendations for the user, similar movie list for a movie, personalised rankings for the recommended movies for the user are obtained.Similar recommendations are built using the K-Nearest neighbour item and user-based recommendations and surprise library algorithms.
